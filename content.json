The conference target audience is diverse and includes those working in the higher education, vocational education and training (VET), K-12, corporate, government, and healthcare sectors.

Function create a connection socket when contacted by a client (browser); receive the HTTP request from this connection; parse the request to determine the specific file being requested; get the requested file from the server’s file system; create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines; send the response over the TCP connection to the requesting client. If the client requests a file that is not present in the server, the server will return a “404 Not Found” error message. NoteYour can run server program, and then test server program by sending requests from the client programs running on different hosts. You may run the server on your own computer, using the IP address of 127.0.0.1. If you run server on a host that already has a Web server running on it, then you should use a different port than port 80 for your Web server. Technical routesI develop my code in two stages. In the first stage, I simply implement the server program to receive the HTTP request messages and display the contents. After this is running properly, I add the code to generate appropriate responses in the second stage. The Web server have a log file to record statistics of the client requests. Each request corresponds to one line of record in the log. Write down client hostname/IP address, access time, requested file name and response type for each record. My Web server also can handle some simple errors, such as web-page not found. NoteI use Python languages for the project. When implementing the Web server, I use basic socket programming classes to build the Web server from scratch instead of using the HTTPServer class directly.","link":"/2023/01/05/webSever/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Photography","slug":"Photography","link":"/tags/Photography/"},{"name":"Travel","slug":"Travel","link":"/tags/Travel/"},{"name":"Cheung Chau","slug":"Cheung-Chau","link":"/tags/Cheung-Chau/"},{"name":"Students Assistants","slug":"Students-Assistants","link":"/tags/Students-Assistants/"},{"name":"TALE 2022","slug":"TALE-2022","link":"/tags/TALE-2022/"},{"name":"Pedagogy","slug":"Pedagogy","link":"/tags/Pedagogy/"},{"name":"Educational technology","slug":"Educational-technology","link":"/tags/Educational-technology/"},{"name":"Tai Mo Shan","slug":"Tai-Mo-Shan","link":"/tags/Tai-Mo-Shan/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","link":"/tags/Python/"},{"name":"Multi-thread","slug":"Multi-thread","link":"/tags/Multi-thread/"},{"name":"Web server","slug":"Web-server","link":"/tags/Web-server/"},{"name":"Wireshark","slug":"Wireshark","link":"/tags/Wireshark/"},{"name":"Project","slug":"Project","link":"/tags/Project/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Photography","slug":"Photography","link":"/categories/Photography/"},{"name":"Employment record","slug":"Employment-record","link":"/categories/Employment-record/"},{"name":"Project","slug":"Project","link":"/categories/Project/"}],"pages":[{"title":"categories","text":"","link":"/categories/index.html"}]}
